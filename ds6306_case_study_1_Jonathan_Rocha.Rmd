## Executive Summary

DDSAnalytics was engaged by Frito Lay to identify factors related to employee attrition and develop predictive models to reduce turnover costs. This analysis explores patterns in attrition, builds machine learning models to predict which employees might leave, and quantifies the potential cost savings of implementing these models.

### Key Findings

1. **Overall Situation**: Frito Lay has a 16.1% attrition rate (140 of 870 employees), with replacement costs ranging from 50-400% of annual salary.

2. **Top 3 Factors Contributing to Attrition**:
   - **Overtime**: Employees working overtime have 3.3Ã— higher attrition (31.7% vs. 9.7%)
   - **Total Working Years**: Less experienced employees are significantly more likely to leave (correlation: -0.167)
   - **Job Level/Monthly Income**: Entry-level positions have 26.1% attrition vs. 5-10% for higher levels

3. **Model Performance**:
   - Our gradient boosting model achieved 69.1% sensitivity and 69.4% specificity
   - This exceeds the requirement of 60% for both metrics
   - The model effectively balances identifying potential leavers while minimizing false alarms

4. **Financial Impact**:
   - Implementing the model could save approximately $5 million (69%) in attrition-related costs
   - This is based on a mid-range replacement cost estimate (225% of annual salary)
   - ROI increases with higher replacement cost scenarios

## Introduction

This report analyzes employee attrition data provided by Frito Lay to identify factors related to employee turnover. DDSAnalytics has been tasked with developing predictive models to identify employees who may leave the company, as well as understanding the primary factors contributing to attrition.

According to research, replacing an employee can cost between 50% and 400% of their salary, while providing targeted retention incentives costs approximately $200 per employee. This analysis aims to build models that can help Frito Lay allocate retention resources efficiently and reduce overall attrition-related costs.

### Project Objectives

1. Identify the top three factors that contribute to employee attrition at Frito Lay
2. Build predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving
3. Ensure models achieve at least 60% sensitivity and 60% specificity
4. Measure the potential cost savings of implementing the predictive model
5. Make predictions for the 300 unlabeled competition dataset employees

## Data Import and Preparation

```{r data_import}
# Import the dataset
attrition_data <- read.csv("~/Desktop/School Projects/SMU/DS_6306_Doing-Data-Science/project/Source Files/CaseStudy1-data.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# Take a look at the data structure
str(attrition_data)

# Basic summary of the data
summary(attrition_data)

# How many rows and columns?
dim(attrition_data)
```

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

```{r data_cleaning}
# Check for missing values
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(attrition_data))
print(paste("Number of variables with missing values:", sum(missing_values > 0)))

# Create a clean dataset for analysis by removing non-predictive features
attrition_clean <- attrition_data %>%
  select(-EmployeeCount, -EmployeeNumber, -ID, -StandardHours, -Over18) 

# Confirm the structure of the cleaned dataset
str(attrition_clean)

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Our analysis of employee attrition at Frito Lay yielded several key insights that can help the company reduce turnover costs and improve retention.

### Key Findings

1. **Overall attrition rate**: 16.1% of employees have left the company (140 of 870 employees).

2. **Top 3 factors driving attrition**:
   - **Overtime**: Employees working overtime are 3.3 times more likely to leave (31.7% vs. 9.7% attrition rate).
   - **Total Working Years**: Less experienced employees have significantly higher attrition rates, with a negative correlation of -0.167.
   - **Job Level/Income**: Entry-level positions (Level 1) have 26.1% attrition compared to 5-10% at higher levels.

3. **Other important factors**:
   - Marital status (singles have higher attrition at 25.6%)
   - Job role (Sales Representatives have the highest attrition at 45.3%)
   - Work-life balance (poor balance correlates with higher turnover)

4. **Predictive model performance**:
   - Our gradient boosting model with threshold optimization achieved 69.1% sensitivity and 69.4% specificity.
   - This means we can correctly identify approximately 69% of employees who will leave and 69% of those who will stay.

5. **Financial impact**:
   - Implementing the model could save Frito Lay approximately $5 million (69% reduction) in attrition-related costs.
   - This is based on a mid-range replacement cost estimate (225% of annual salary).
   - ROI remains strong across all replacement cost scenarios.

### Recommendations

Based on our findings, we recommend the following actions:

1. **Target overtime management**:
   - Review and potentially restructure workloads for employees currently working overtime.
   - Consider additional compensation or time-off benefits for necessary overtime work.
   - Monitor and manage overtime more proactively, especially for high-risk groups.

2. **Support less experienced employees**:
   - Implement mentoring programs pairing newer employees with experienced team members.
   - Develop structured onboarding and training programs to accelerate professional development.
   - Create clear career paths with milestones to help employees visualize their growth opportunities.

3. **Improve entry-level positions**:
   - Review compensation structures for entry-level roles, especially for Sales Representatives.
   - Create clearer advancement paths from Level 1 positions.
   - Consider targeted benefits or incentives for entry-level employees at high risk of leaving.

4. **Implement the predictive model**:
   - Integrate the model into HR systems to regularly identify at-risk employees.
   - Develop a targeted intervention program for employees flagged as high risk.
   - Allocate the $200 retention incentive strategically to those most likely to leave.

5. **Ongoing monitoring and refinement**:
   - Track the effectiveness of retention initiatives and refine approaches over time.
   - Periodically retrain the model with new data to maintain its accuracy.
   - Continue to investigate other potential factors affecting attrition.

By implementing these recommendations, Frito Lay can significantly reduce attrition costs while improving employee satisfaction and retention, leading to a more stable and productive workforce.
