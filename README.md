# Employee Attrition Analysis - DS 6306 Project

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis and predictive modeling for employee attrition as part of the DS 6306 - Doing Data Science course at SMU. The project focuses on identifying factors that contribute to employee attrition and building predictive models to help organizations proactively address retention issues.
